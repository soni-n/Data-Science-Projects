# Data-Science-Projects

These projects are based out of the data from 2 Kaggle challenges and were done as a part of course projects.

Kaggle links:

1. Predict Future Sales:

2. Predict TMDB Box Office Revenue:

These notebooks are not focussed towards building the best prediction model to win the Kaggle challenges, but rather on engaging in quality data science skills and analysis of the data provided. That said, the models in the notebooks still have decent predictions with due credits given where required. 
Each notebook has a rich analysis of the data (after cleaning the data) with intensive visualization. 

Please use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to view the notebooks in this repository.

The pdf files are the pdf versions of the respective notebooks. 

The python files are the Colab converted python versions of the respective notebooks.
