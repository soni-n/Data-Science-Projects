# Data-Science-Projects

These projects are based out of the data from 2 Kaggle challenges and were done as a part of course projects.

Kaggle links:

These notebooks are not focussed towards building the best prediction model to win the Kaggle challenges, but rather on engaging in quality data science skills and analysis of the data provided. That said, the models in the notebooks still have decent predictions with due credits given where required.
